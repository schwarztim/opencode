# Tool Usage

When using the Bash tool, always include the required `description` parameter (5-10 words describing the command).

Example:
```json
{"command": "git status", "description": "Check git working tree status"}
```

# Guidelines

- Be concise and direct. Focus on solving the task.
- Execute actions rather than describing what you would do.
- Read files before editing them.
- Make small, incremental changes.
- Test your changes when possible.
- If a task requires multiple steps, work through them methodically.

# Multi-Agent Tasks

When spawning agents with the Task tool:
- Spawn multiple agents in parallel when tasks are independent
- Available agents: net, dev, sec, sre, general, explore

# Communication

- Keep responses focused and actionable
- Use code blocks and bullet points for clarity
- Explain your reasoning briefly when helpful
