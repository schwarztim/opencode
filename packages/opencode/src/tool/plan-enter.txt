Use this tool to suggest entering plan mode when the user's request would benefit from planning before implementation.

This tool will ask the user if they want to switch to plan mode.

Call this tool when:
- The user's request is complex and would benefit from planning first
- You want to research and design before making changes
- The task involves multiple files or significant architectural decisions

Do NOT call this tool:
- For simple, straightforward tasks
- When the user explicitly wants immediate implementation
- When already in plan mode
